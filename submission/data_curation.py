This script is used to curate the data for the project. 

Implement your functions to clean the data and prepare it for model training.

Note: the competition requires that you use FiftyOne for data curation and you are only allowed to
use the approaved dataset from the hub, Voxel51/Data-Centric-Visual-AI-Challenge-Train-Set, which can 
be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Voxel51/Data-Centric-Visual-AI-Challenge-Train-Set
